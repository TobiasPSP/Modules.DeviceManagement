# Modules.DeviceManagement
PowerShell module to manage devices and drivers

This module is based on work published here: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/PowerShell-Device-60d73bb0
The sorce code is available here: https://github.com/AutomatedLab/DeviceManagement

Since the TechNet gallery is deprecated soon and there is no easily accessible PowerShell module available on the PowerShell Gallery, I decided to publish one.
